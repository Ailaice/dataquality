#### 8.1 - End of Course - Reflective Exercise (15 min)

Now that you've completed the Level 2 Data Quality Self-Paced Course, have a moment to think about what you've learned, and then answer the following questions.

### 8.1.1 Poll: Which of the following will be the first action you’ll perform to improve data quality in your DHIS2 instance?

- Use the WHO Data Quality tool

- Configure data quality notifications and alerts

- Run Data Quality checks when entering data

- Improve data capture processes and forms

- Check Data Quality app configuration

Feedback: Whichever action you make, you will be improving the quality of your data and, therefore, the decision-making process. We encourage you to apply more than one tool and keep learning!

### 8.1.2 Discussion Forum: Main takeaways from the course

Before finishing this course, we want you to have the chance to reflect on what you have learned and think about how and when you will apply this new knowledge. To do this, answer the following questions in the forum:

- What are your 3 key takeaways from the course?

- What are some of the tools learned that you could start applying right after finishing this course?

- What new questions about data quality do you have now ?

Take this opportunity to think about applying the concepts you have learned and to share them with your peers. This exercise will be useful to reinforce what you have learned and help you take this new knowledge into your daily routine.

Please note that as a self-paced course, this forum will not be moderated by a tutor.
