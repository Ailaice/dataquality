## 2.0 Overview of the module (5 min)

#### What’s in this module? (5 min)

##### What’s in this module?

### What’s in this module?

In the previous module, you learned the basics of what Data Quality is and how it is relevant in the context of a national Health Management Information System (HMIS). But how do you check for Data Quality issues? Which tools can you use in DHIS2?

In this module, you’ll be taught how to use the WHO Data Quality Tool to check your data for data quality issues. Your instructor, Bob Pond, an expert in the tool, will introduce you to the tool and available documentation, then walk you through **how to use the different dashboards within the tool.** You’ll start by looking at the **Completeness Dashboard,** then the **Consistency - Time, Consistency - Data, and Outliers Dashboards** and then the **Analysis Function** within the tool. Finally, you’ll look at **how to train District level staff on key areas of the WHO Data Quality Tool** to ensure that data quality is at the heart

### Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Check data quality using the Completeness, the Consistency - Time, Consistency - Data, and the Outliers Dashboards inside the WHO Data Quality Tool

- Use the Analysis Function inside the WHO Data Quality Tool

- Identify the advantages of an adequate data quality training program on the use of the WHO Data Quality Tool

### How will you be evaluated?

As this module focuses on using the WHO Data Quality tool, you’ll be assessed on how to use different parts of the tool through a series of activities at the end of each video. This will contribute 10% to your final grade.

### How long will this module take?

This module should take about **3 hours 10 min** to complete.

In addition, optional video resources are available at the end of the module, which should take an additional **40 minutes** to review.
