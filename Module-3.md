# Module 3: Data Quality notifications and alerts (4h 20 min)

## 3.0 - Overview of the module (5 min)

#### 3.0.1 - What's in this Module? (5 min)

Now that you’ve looked at the WHO Data Quality Tool, what other Data Quality features are available in DHIS2?

In this module you will explore **how validation rules and predictors can be used to ensure data quality in DHIS2**, and you’ll also look at the **Data Quality App within DHIS2**. First, Scott Russpatrick will start by exploring how you can use Validation Rules and how they can be configured to notify you and your team of any Data Quality issues. After that, Scott will show you how Standard Deviation Predictors can be used to identify outliers in your data sets.

Then, Norah Stoops from HISP South Africa will introduce you to the DHIS2 Data Quality App. You’ll start by looking at how you can **set up validation rules inside of the application**. Next, you’ll look at **how you can use the Data Quality App to conduct a Desk Review of Data Quality**, with an example of how South Sudan conducted its own Desk Review. Finally, you’ll look at **how Min/Max values can be used to improve your Data Quality.**

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Identify how Validation Rules can be used to improve Data Quality

- Create Validation Rules that trigger notifications when Data Quality issues arise

- Create Standard Deviation predictors can be used to identify outliers

- Indicate the advantages of using the DHIS2 Data Quality App

- Understand what Min/Max values are in the Data Quality App

- Configure Min/Max values in the Data Quality App

### How will you be evaluated?

In this Module, you’ll be assessed through a number of different exercises, focusing on Validation Rules, Min/Max analysis, and Standard Deviation Predictors. These exercises will contribute 10% to your final grade.

### How long will this module take?

This module should take about **4 hours 20 min** to complete

##### Instructions - Account Creation on DHIS2 Data Quality Configuration

### Instructions - Account Creation on DHIS2 Data Quality Configuration

In order to perform the exercises and assignments within Module 3, you will be accessing the **DHIS2** **Data QualityConfiguration (Config)** training instance. The **DHIS2 Data Quality Config** training instance has been set up to allow each person that logs in to configure metadata, including data elements, data sets, predictors, validation rules and validation rule notifications. The account you create will have limited access to the apps within DHIS2, only including the apps referenced in the screenshot below. This access will allow for you to create and check on the necessary metadata required to perform the exercises within this module via the Maintenance app.

DocumentationFollowing the video on Standard Deviation Predictors, this exercise is meant to give you a chance to practice and help reinforce your understanding of how to use predictors for outlier detection validation rules, including identifying outliers using Predictors and configuring Outlier Notification Rules.

This exercise is ungraded so you do not have to complete it to pass the course, but we highly recommend that you complete this exercise to improve your understanding of the material.

If you require additional guidance, please review the [Metadata: Managing Predictors](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/configuring-the-system/metadata.html#manage_predictor) Guide.

##### Set-up - Creating Outlier Notifications using Validation Rules

### Set-up - Creating Outlier Notifications using Validation Rules

This exercise will be completed in the [DHIS2 Data Quality Config](https://academy.dq.dhis2.org/dq-config) training instance. Follow the set up instructions in **Module 3.0.2** to create your account, if you have not already done so, then log in to [DHIS2 Data Quality Config](https://academy.dq.dhis2.org/dq-config) and follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.

##### Exercise Part 1: Using Predictor Rules to Identify Outliers

### Exercise Part 1: Using Predictor Rules to Identify Outliers

In the first part of this exercise, you will practice how to configure predictors for outlier detection. Follow the steps below to create and run your predictor. If you would like additional information on why predictors are used to calculate outliers in DHIS2 and step-by-step guidance on how to complete Part 1 of this exercise, you can review the [How to Use Predictors to Identify Outliers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FAqHn0Obne27pJTWkWJmaJHKj1H7aaum/view?usp=sharing) document.

1. Create a Data Element to store the predicted value for ANC1 Outlier Threshold. Call the data element *ANC1 Outlier Threshold – YourName (Ex: ANC1 Outlier Threshold – Scott)*

2. Create a Predictor that calculates the ANC outlier threshold. Call the Predictor: *ANC1 Outlier Threshold – YourName*

3. Run your Predictor. Follow the instructions that are available in the How to Use Predictors to Identify Outliers document for guidance on how to verify that your Predictor has run successfully in the DHIS2 Data Quality Config instance.

### Exercise Progress

1 point possible (ungraded)

I have completed the Part 1 of this exercise and confirm that my Predictor has run successfully in the DHIS2 Data Quality Config instance.

1. **Yes**

2. No

##### Exercise Part 2: Creating Outlier Notifications using Validation Rules

### Exercise Part 2: Creating Outlier Notifications using Validation Rules

In the second part of this exercise, you will create a Validation Rule using the Predictor that you configured in Part 1, and configure a Validation Rule Notification. For additional guidance on how to complete these steps, please refer back to the Standard Deviation Predictors video in Module 3.2.1.

*Note: if you are doing this configuration in a live DHIS2 system instead of the DHIS2 Data Quality Config instance, please see the special instructions at the bottom of this page.*

1. Create a Validation Rule to check if ANC1 is greater than your ANC1 outlier threshold. Call the validation rule: *ANC1 Outlier Threshold – YourName*. It should look something like this.

<img src="/static/image10.png" style="width:3.2077in;height:5.79688in">

2. Create a Validation Rule Group including your ANC1 Outlier Threshold. Call the Validation Rule Group: *ANC1 Outlier Threshold – YourName.* The group will look like this:

<img src="/static/image11.png" style="width:9in;height:6.33333in">

3. Create a Validation Rule Notification for your Validation Rule Group. Call the Notification: *ANC1 Outlier Threshold validation rule – YourName*. You will have your own user group that you were added to as part of signing up for this system. Use this user group now to decide who receives the validation notification under the heading “Recipient user groups.” The notification should look like this when completed.

<img src="/static/image12.png" style="width:7.54993in;height:4.45854in">

<img src="/static/image13.png" style="width:7.61979in;height:7.19647in">

4. Check your Rule and Notification by running a Validation Rule Analysis

1. Run it at the national level

2. Run it for the period January 1, 2021 – June 30, 2021

3. Select the Validation Rule Group you have created

4. Ensure “Send notifications” is selected. To receive the notification, you must have your email entered within your user profile.

5. Select Validate to run the analysis. Check your result in DHIS2.

6. Check your email, you should receive the notification as well.

<img src="/static/image14.png" style="width:9in;height:3.73611in">

Similar to predictors, the running of validation rules and sending notifications can be automated through the use of the scheduler; however you would use the job type “Monitoring.”

### Exercise Progress

1 point possible (ungraded)

I have completed the Part 2 of this exercise and confirm that my Validation Rule has run correctly and that I have received a Validation Rule Notification.

1. **Yes**

2. No

*Instructions for using a live DHIS2 system instead of the DHIS2 Data Quality Config server:*

1. Schedule your predictors to run in the scheduler application. Call your job: *ANC1 Outlier Threshold Predictor Calculation – YourName*

2. Schedule your validation rule monitoring job. Call this job: *ANC1 Outlier Threshold Alerts – YourName*

3. Ensure that your predictor runs **before** your validation rule monitoring job, otherwise you may not have generated outliers to compare your actual value to when running your validation rule analysis.
