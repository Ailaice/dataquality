## 0.1 About the course (10 min)

#### About the course

##### Welcome to the Data Quality Academy - Level 2

### Welcome to the Data Quality Academy - Level 2

Welcome to the **DHIS2 Level 2 Data Quality Academy**. We at the DHIS2 Academy Team want to thank you for your interest in strengthening your skills in DHIS2. We hope that this course provides you with resources that help you better check, analyze, and improve the quality of your data.

In this module 0, you’ll find an overview of the course, get familiarized with the DHIS2 Online Academy platform, and find the most important information to get started.

### What is this course about?

Reliable and quality data are used to plan, monitor, evaluate, and strengthen health system performance and make evidence-informed decisions. In this course, you will learn how to assess and improve data quality in DHIS2, and prepare the data for information needs.

This course will focus on how to use the WHO Data Quality Tool (“DQ Tool”) and built-in DHIS2 features to identify highly suspicious data values. You will learn about the main elements of the DQ Tool and other DHIS2 data quality features and practice using specially configured DHIS2 training instances.

### What will I learn?

After completing this course, you’ll be able to:

- Verify data quality using the Completeness, Consistency - Time, Consistency - Data, and Outliers dashboards inside the WHO Data Quality Tool.

- Create notifications using the DHIS2 Data Quality App to monitor and improve data quality

- Identify the steps to create a program rule for good data quality when importing Tracker data to Aggregate data sets

- Examine the processes and best practices associated with data capture that impact data quality, such as form design, naming conventions, and metadata, data elements value types, maintenance, and organisation units management

- Install and configure the WHO Data Quality Tool

### What are the course prerequisites?

This is a technical course for implementers/administrators. Completion of a previous Level 1 DHIS2 Academy (or DHIS2 Fundamentals) or equivalent DHIS2 work experience is required.

### How is the course structured?

The Data Quality Level 2 Academy is comprised of 6 modules of content:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to Data Quality (3 h 45 min)

- **Module 2**: Using and Configuring the WHO Data Quality Tool (3 h 10 min)

- **Module 3**: DQ Notifications and Alerts (4 h 20 min)

- **Module 4**: Data Quality Checks During Data Capture (1 h 20 min)

- **Module 5**: DHIS2 Design for Data Quality (4 h)

- **Module 6**: Configuring the WHO Data Quality Tool (2 h 15 min)

Additionally, you will find a module with key information about the course and the platform (this module 0) a final assessment (Module 7) and a final module with a reflective activity to think about the main takeaways of the course.

### How will I learn?

The content of this self-paced course consists mainly of **videos**. Some of these videos were recorded live at the Data Quality Level 2 Academy in October 2020, and have been edited to facilitate access to key topics and their understanding. Any references to specific days of the Academy course in these videos can be ignored.

Before watching each video, you will find a **brief description** of the topics covered on them and a list of **key concepts** to consider when watching the videos. To make it easier to access specific topics in videos longer than 10 minutes, you will find **timestamps** that indicate the points in the video when the different topics start. You will be able to download the presentations used in the live sessions and the videos if you want to save them for later. After watching the videos, you will find knowledge check questions or graded questions that will help you check your understanding.

Throughout the course, you will also find exercises that you must perform in a DHIS2 training instance. These exercises will include a link to the DHIS2 training instance and step-by-step indications to perform the activities. After each exercise, you will have to answer a quiz with multiple-choice questions to measure your performance.

Please note that several different DHIS2 instances are used in this course that are specially configured for certain exercises. These training instances are different from the ones used in other DHIS2 Academies you might have completed before. Some of these instances have a generic user account that you can use to access them, in which case this information is provided on the login screen. Other instances will require you to create your own user account. In these cases, you will find specific instructions on how to create an account in the course modules where those instances are used.

We recommend using either Firefox or Chrome web browser to access the course content and DHIS2 instances properly. We do not recommend Internet Explorer.

### How long will it take to complete the course?

We estimate the course will take approximately **20 hours** to complete. This includes the review of all videos and completing the graded assessments. As this is a self-paced course, note that this may vary slightly for each learner.

### How do I pass the course?

You will need to **do all the course exercises** , **complete the quizzes at the end of each module, and take a final exam** with an overall grade of at least **80%** to pass the course.

You will have **1 or 2 attempts** to submit each question and the final exam. You will find the information about the number of attempts permitted in the instructions of each question.

In addition, we have included a few optional exercises throughout the course. While these exercises are not graded, we encourage you to complete them to improve your understanding of the course material.

### What is the course timeline?

This course is **self-paced**, which means there are **no set deadlines** and you can go through it as fast or as slow as you prefer. This course does not currently have a set end date. In the event that an end date is scheduled, you will be notified with enough time to finish your work in the course.

### How do I get support?

For **technical** support or when you have issues **navigating the platform**, or general questions, you can contact the course moderators for help by email at **dataquality@dhis2.org**. For a quicker response, please don't forget to indicate your username or the email address you used to register on the platform.

For Data Quality questions and to discuss with your peers, please don't hesitate to ask questions on the DHIS2 Community of Practice.

### What should I do now?

We encourage you to participate in these forums to learn from your peers and discuss course material.

### General forum guidelines

You are invited to use the discussion spaces throughout the course to connect with your peers and share your questions and ideas.

The use of the discussion forums is an **optional activity** and is not graded.

Tips for using the discussion forums:

- **Be respectful**. Share your opinions and ideas and respect the opinions of others.

- **Help each other**! Reply to your peers’ questions and comments.

- Actively **up-vote** other posts if you think they are relevant, and other people will up-vote yours! The more up-votes your post has, the more likely it is to be seen.

- Choose the appropriate **category** when posting; this will keep the discussion forum orderly.

- Use a **descriptive and specific** title for your post. This will attract the attention of other learners with the same issue.

- See if someone **has already asked your question** before creating a new post.

- Use “[**netiquette**](https://elearningindustry.com/10-netiquette-tips-online-discussions)” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:

  - Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.

  - Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).

Pro-Tips

- If you find a post particularly interesting and want to return to it in the future, you can **follow it**. To do that, view the post you want to follow and select the “Follow” icon.

- Each post that you follow appears with a “Following” indicator in the list of posts. To list only the posts that you are following, regardless of the discussion topic they apply to, select the drop-down “Discussion” list and select “Posts I’m Following”.

To make this an enjoyable, positive, and constructive experience for all, participants are required to be respectful. Abusive and disrespectful communications **will be removed**. You can help by reporting misuse. You can flag any post, response, or comment for a discussion moderator to review: view the contribution, select the “More” icon, and then select “Report”.
