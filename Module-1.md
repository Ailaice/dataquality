##### 1.0 What is in this Module?

### 1.0 What is in this Module?

What is Data Quality? How do you define Data Quality? How can it be measured?

In this module, you will discover **what Data Quality is**, and how you can **measure good Data Quality**.

You will start by reviewing the foundational concepts of data quality, such as **why it is important to address data quality issues**, and **how to define good Data Quality**. After that, you will look at the **two different data quality methods** and the **4 different Data Quality domains** as defined by the **World Health Organization’s Data Quality Review Framework**. Finally, you will look at **three different use cases** where DHIS2 has been used to implement good data quality practices.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Recognize how to spot bad Data Quality practices

- Distinguish the four dimensions of Data Quality described in the WHO Data Quality Review Framework

- Relate the four dimensions of data quality with the data quality review measures applied in a specific country

### How will you be evaluated?

Since understanding, reflection and analysis of data quality concepts is key to taking advantage of the rest of the course, the reflective exercise that you will find at the end of the module will be graded and will contribute 5% to your final grade. You will find the instructions in section 1.4.

### How long will this module take?

This module should take about **3 hours 45 min** to complete.

Internal consistency

External Consistency

Consistency of Population Estimates

### 1.4.2 Discussion Forum: How do you currently measure the quality of data in your country?

Before finishing this module, we want you to have the chance to reflect on the concepts of data quality and the experiences of South Africa, Sri Lanka and Rwanda implementing measures to improve their data quality. To do this, answer the following questions in the forum:

- Broadly speaking, how is data quality currently measured in your country?

- Following the 4 domains of the WHO data quality framework, which one would you say is the most relevant for improving the data quality in your country?

- What ideas did you come up with during the module to implement improvements in the data quality review?

Take this opportunity to think about the application of the concepts you have learned and to share with your peers. This exercise will be useful to reinforce what you have learned and continue with the following modules of the course.

Please note that as a self-paced course this forum will not be moderated by a tutor.
